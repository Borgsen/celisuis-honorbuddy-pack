Okay here is how to edit it.

Within the CandyBucketAuras.cs you will see at the top:

        /*Change the following only!*/
        private string userlanguage = "English";
        /* Available languages:
         * "Deutsch"
         * "Espanol"
         * "Francias"
         * "Russian"
         * 
         * If your WoW client needs a different Macro, change the following so it works*/
        private string cancelaura = "/cancelaura";

        /* DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING BELOW THIS! */
		

There should only be two things you will/may have to change.
#1:  The userlanguage = "____";
If you are using one of the language listed below that, copy and paste it up into where it says "English"
Available language:  Deutsch, Espanol, Francias, Russian (I believe)	
 AGAIN, COPY AND PASTE IT!  Do not type it in, or it may not work with the rest of the file.
 
#2 the cancelaura = "/cancelaura";
This is a macro that will be sent to your WoW client.  If your macros would be /cancelenaurao or something please change it to that :)


#3  Load the plugin in HB, and go get you some Candy!!!!


Again, if this works well I ask you to hop onto the thread you got it from and leave some feedback :)
