	<!-- Blackspot work by blacklisting the current 'tile' it is on
	so if the area you are in is very flat, blackspots may not work at all.
	HB pathing doesnt 'like' to go through blackspots, but if going around them
	would take longer than the danger of going through them, it will still go through them.
	These can be created in the dev tools window.
	Definition:  A blackspot is basically a circle on the ground ( in very simple terms) that HB doesn't want to walk through (this is not entirely correct)
	HowToGet: You will create a blackspot using HB, you will click a button twice.
	Start at the first outer edge of your circle
	Click once on Generate Blackspot in the Dev Tools window.
	Move to the completely opposite side of the blackspot circle
	Click again on Generate Blackspot.
	The new <Blackspot xyz /> tag is now in your HB window.
	Copy and paste it in-between the <Blackspots></Blackspots> tags -->
