Current Version: 1.1.1

Changes:
//Version 1.1.1
Removed the useless FrameLock (no reason, just wanted to try it out)
Added a /PetAbandon() macro to the invisibility function, so frost mages don't stay in combat because of the pet.
Added for it to stop casting before trying to cast Invisibility, and it will now remove the target also (The CC should stop targetting, no POI)

//Version 1.1.0
Updated heavily (in comparison to ammount of code)
-Added FrameLocks (because I was bored, and wanted to see how they worked)
-Reworking of how the bot checks to see if the blink to POI/Loot will be successful
	-Now checks the HB Navigator to see if only 1 click remains (the click to the loot)
-Also added a single variable to turn on/off the logs (just havent added it to the settings yet)
	-The Logging should ALWAYS be off unless I tell you to turn it on, because it spams the shit out of the log.
-Changed where my methods are, cleaned up the main file
[Things to add]
-Check for the +5 yards blink Glyph, and adjust distances accordingly
-Anything else that is requested (if worth the time)
-Potentially adding teleporting to repair/mail, and using a portal/teleport to continent back (gonna be a while before this is done :P )
-Potentially having it blink to the next pathing point, intead of only blinking only straight to the loot

//Version 1.0.2
Changed where it saves the settings file to: /HB/Settings/MageHelper/[ToonNameAndSuch].xml

Changed it to check for if you are a mage before it does any other checks.


//Version 1.0.1
Invisibilty now checks for non friendly mobs and also doesn't check the see if the mob is targetting you (most CCs use Polymorph so it made that part useless)
-Invisibility should now work as described.

Changed the Blink method to look at current POI instead of useing Objectmanager.
-This made it so you wouldn't blink towards a lootable when the bot was moving towards a closer lootable (blinked to the wrong loot, the bot would run back)
